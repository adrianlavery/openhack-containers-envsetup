## :dart: About ##

This readme file explains how to get the Source Code repository set up for the Microsoft Containers Hack.  It is mandated that a PRIVATE Github repository is created by a participant in every hack team and all other participants work locally and contribute to this central private repository. 

Each hack particpiant will contribute directly to this repository, rather than clone it.

In addition, if you don't already have an environment setup to execute the hack from, you will find the instructions on how to set up a Visual Studio Codespace to execute all of the hack challenges from.

## :checkered_flag: Instructions for Setting Up Github ##

Follow the Instructions below to create a Private repository and copy the source code that you will need 

1) Create a new repo.  For the repo name, use 'Teamx-OurContOH' - replacing 'x' with your team number.  

*IMPORTANT* You MUST create this repo as a PRIVATE Repo and only ONE member of your hack team needs to perform this step (Everyone in the team will connect and work from the same repo)

Make sure not to check any of the boxes to initiate it and click create.

2) Once the repo has been created, you will see the Quick Setup page, scroll to the bottom and click 'Import Code'

<br>

3) In the field 'Your old repository's clone URL' enter the URL of the Containers Hack Repo : 'https://github.com/Azure-Samples/openhack-containers' and click on 'Begin Import'

<br>

## Grant your fellow hackers access to the repo ##

1) Once you have created your private repo and imported the source code you now need to invite your hacker team collegues to collaborate to the repo with you. Navigate to the 'Settings' area of your repo and click on 'Manage Access'

2) Ask the hacker for their GitHub Username and enter it into the Username field, then click on 'Invite <username> to this repository'

Repeat step 2 until all the members of your hacker team have been invited to collaborate
